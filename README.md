Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes that can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, with the smallest disk on top.


The goal is to move the entire stack of disks from the starting rod to another rod, following these rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
